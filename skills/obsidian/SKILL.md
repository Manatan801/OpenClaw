# Obsidian

Obsidian vault = a normal folder on disk.

Vault structure (typical)

- Notes: `*.md` (plain text Markdown; edit with any editor)
- Config: `.obsidian/` (workspace + plugin settings; usually don’t touch from scripts)
- Canvases: `*.canvas` (JSON)
- Attachments: whatever folder you chose in Obsidian settings (images/PDFs/etc.)

## Find the active vault(s)

Obsidian desktop tracks vaults here (source of truth):

- `~/Library/Application Support/obsidian/obsidian.json`

`obsidian-cli` resolves vaults from that file; vault name is typically the **folder name** (path suffix).

Fast “what vault is active / where are the notes?”

- If you’ve already set a default: `obsidian-cli print-default --path-only`
- Otherwise, read `~/Library/Application Support/obsidian/obsidian.json` and use the vault entry with `"open": true`.

Notes

- Multiple vaults common (iCloud vs `~/Documents`, work/personal, etc.). Don’t guess; read config.
- Avoid writing hardcoded vault paths into scripts; prefer reading the config or using `print-default`.

## obsidian-cli quick start

Pick a default vault (once):

- `obsidian-cli set-default "<vault-folder-name>"`
- `obsidian-cli print-default` / `obsidian-cli print-default --path-only`

Search

- `obsidian-cli search "query"` (note names)
- `obsidian-cli search-content "query"` (inside notes; shows snippets + lines)

Create

- `obsidian-cli create "Folder/New note" --content "..." --open`
- Requires Obsidian URI handler (`obsidian://…`) working (Obsidian installed).
- Avoid creating notes under “hidden” dot-folders (e.g. `.something/...`) via URI; Obsidian may refuse.

Move/rename (safe refactor)

- `obsidian-cli move "old/path/note" "new/path/note"`
- Updates `[[wikilinks]]` and common Markdown links across the vault (this is the main win vs `mv`).

Delete

- `obsidian-cli delete "path/note"`

Prefer direct edits when appropriate: open the `.md` file and change it; Obsidian will pick it up.

## Second Brain Protocol (Usage Guide)

### Directory Standard (PARA)
- `00_Inbox/`: New/Unsorted items.
- `10_Journal/Daily/`: Daily notes `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- `10_Journal/Interactions/`: System logs.
- `20_Projects/`: Active goals.

### Common Workflows

**1. Create Daily Note**
Check if exists (`ls 10_Journal/Daily/`). If not, create:
```bash
# Verify path first!
mkdir -p "10_Journal/Daily"
echo "# Daily Note: $(date +%F)" > "10_Journal/Daily/$(date +%F).md"
```

**2. Log Interaction**
Save important chats to `10_Journal/Interactions/`:
```bash
mkdir -p "10_Journal/Interactions"
# Format: YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_Title.md
echo "..." > "10_Journal/Interactions/$(date +%F_%H%M)_Subject.md"
```

**3. Search Context**
Before searching web, search brain:
```bash
obsidian-cli search "keywords"
# or grep if direct access
grep -r "keywords" .
```
